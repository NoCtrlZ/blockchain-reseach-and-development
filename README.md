![badge](https://action-badges.now.sh/NoCtrlZ/blockchain-reseach-and-development?action=test)   
This is research and development for blockchain implementation from scratch.
## Setup
```
$ makers it
```
## Abstract
Creating blockchain proofs the ownership of digital contents with cool way! With this blockchain, all developer can create Dapp with no knowledge about blockchain by just installing wrapper module. It can have an impact on both art and blockchain industry. Next age comming soon😎
## Directory
### 🛰️blockchain
Development about blockchain data structure including struct of `blockchain` itself, `block` and `transaction`. Also has methods to chage the data structure like `create_new_block`, `send_transaction`, `proof_of_work` and so on.
### 📡p2p
Development about p2p client including syncing method with other nodes. Creating Json server which is used as endpoint by user from scratch.
### 🚀integration
Integration result of research and development. This behaves as actual blockchain which proofs the ownership of digital contents. So cool
## Test
```
$ makers ts
```
